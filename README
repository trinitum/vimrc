This distribution contains my .vimrc and .vim. It includes some files
are work of other people, particularly:

- perl syntax and indent files from http://github.com/petdance/vim-perl
- bufexplorer plugin http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=42

Some of these files were modified by me to my taste, see Changes for
details
